# Sonic 1 SGDK Remake
An offensively bad Sonic 1 remake in SGDK. I sincerely apologize.

## How 2 build

### Requirements
 - MARSDEV (Linux & macOS)/SGDK (Windows)
 - ctrmml (for compiling music data)
    - Must also define its path in an environment variable called "CTRMML_DIR"

### Building
 - On Linux: use the included build.fish
 - On Windows: not yet supported
 - On macOS: Someone else check that, I don't have a Mac
